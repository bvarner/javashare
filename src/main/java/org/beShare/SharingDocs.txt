		and write it to a given file. Tranto will construct and destroy these as necessary

SharedFileReader - A Runnable class which will read a file, and then write the data to the specified port.
		This class performs the opposite of the SharedFileWriter.

SharePanel - Responsible for showing the results of the current query, as well as the ProgressPanel.
